# My dotfiles

This is my implementation of dotfiles, compliant with Danny's wonderful [oh-your-dotfiles]() framework

### Add Post-upgrade to Big Sur:

`terminal/install.homebrew-cask`
- little-snitch

### Add on different machine

These brew packages were already installed on my latest machine, but I should add them back to my dotfiles later
